# File Conversion System

File conversion system is a software system that converts files from one format to another. It involves the use of various components such as readers, formatters, enrichers, filters, and writers, which work together to ensure that the files are properly converted. The system typically takes a file as input, processes it using the appropriate components, and produces an output file in the desired format
